# Minimal ISE Project for VHDL

> Minimal project using ISE for VHDL simulations, example with a DFF.

## Prerequisites

* Xilinx ISE Design Suite (<https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/design-tools.html>) 
> All tools for compilation, synthesis, simulation and bistream generation

## Organization

* __SRC/__ : Contains _.vhd_ files describing the componants.
* __BENCH/__ : Contains _.vhd_ files describing the testbench for the componants.
* __PRJ/__ : Contains _.prj_ files containing all the componants to compile in your design in compilation order.
* __SIM/__ : Contains the binary file doing the simulation, it's generated by the `fuse` command.
* __SCRIPTS/__ : Contains the `tcl` script for the simulation, can be passed as an argument of the binary file.
* __Makefile__ : Contains the commands to compile a design and launch the simulation.
